# MagLev

The main aim is Neural Network Modelling of a nonlinear Magnetic Levitation System.

All simulations were run on MATLAB R2020a.

Currently, input-output data is obtained by exciting the Magnetic Levitation System with an Amplitude-modulated Pseudo Ranfom Binary Sequence (APRBS).

In the next step, a simple Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron in present day terminology) will be developed for it. A Neural Network model is already developed. The code will be uploaded next week!
